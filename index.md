# This is the way...
No eye for attention (Attention) But they know my name No place for the question But the answers changed Cut from a different cloth Ive never turned back to the waves Ive crossed
Throw my demons to the fire
Something inside thats
Awaken tonight and
A warriors silence
But I couldnt be saved
Shadows deceivin
A path I believe in
But I wont be flyin in place
This is the way
New sin for the taking 
Try to find my code 
No armor is breaking
Im gonna walk this road
Light from a different star
I've never gone back on a life this far
Forgotten blood of an empire 
Something inside that's
Awaken tonight and
A warriors silence
But I couldn't be saved
Shadows deceivin
A path I believe in
But I wont be flyin in place
This is the way
This is the way
This is the way
Cut from a different cloth
Ive never turned back to the waves Ive crossed
Throw my demons to the fire
Throw my demons to the fire
Something inside thats
Awaken tonight and
A warriors silence
But I couldnt be saved 
Shadows deceivin
A path I believe in
But I won't be flyin in place
This is the way
This is the way
This is the way
Shadows deceivin
A path I believe in
But I won't be flyin in place
This is the way
