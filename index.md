# This is the way...
No eye for attention (Attention)
But they know my name
No place for the question (Question)
But the answer's changed
Cut from a different cloth
I've never turned back to the waves I've crossed
Throw my demons to the fire
Something inside that's
Awaken tonight and
A warrior's silence
But I couldn't be saved
Shadows deceivin'
A path I believe in
But I won't be flyin' in place
This is the way
New sin for the taking (Taking)
Try to find my code (Code)
No armor is breaking (Breaking)
I'm gonna walk this road
Light from a different star
I've never gone back on a life this far
Forgotten blood of an empire (Empire)
Something inside that's
Awaken tonight and
A warrior's silence
But I couldn't be saved
Shadows deceivin'
A path I believe in
But I won't be flyin' in place
This is the way
This is the way
This is the way
Cut from a different cloth
I've never turned back to the waves I've crossed
Throw my demons to the fire
Throw my demons to the fire
Something inside that's
Awaken tonight and
A warrior's silence
But I couldn't be saved (Couldn't be saved)
Shadows deceivin'
A path I believe in
But I won't be flyin' in place
This is the way
This is the way
This is the way
Shadows deceivin'
A path I believe in
But I won't be flyin' in place
This is the way
